**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**
 Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that wants to have their custom API optimized with the newest software security methods to help protect against external threats.

**What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**
 I was able to implement and run the dependency checker on the existing code base to help identify security vulberabilities. I learned how to read the report and compare the findings to determine next steps in securing the application. Secure coding helps protect both the company and its clients against data loss and identity theft attempts. Being able to provide secure transactions is critical to a business' success and reputation among clients in the financial industry. 

**What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**
 I found the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram unclear and less than helpful when trying to apply it to the assignment. It lists specific aspects of the application and security but doesn't provide much information that helps to identify anything specifically helpful or actionable.

**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?** I approached the need to increase layers of security by focusing on the more general types of security and then moving into more detailed aspects that relate to the specific application's needs. I will continue to use the dependency check report and the associated vulnerability databases to identify risks and help to find mitigation actions.

**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**
I made sure the code was functional by running the application and resolving any errors presented by the IDE. I also ran the dependency check tool to help identify any existing vulnerabilities. I followed the same steps after refactoring the code to ensure it was functional and secure.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**
I learned to implement and decipher the maven dependency check tool as well as the keytool application to generate certificates used in browser security.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?** I would use my knowledge and ability to check existing code for security vulnerabilities. I would also point out that I can identify and suppress false positives from the report. I also have working knowledge of security certificates and can utilize them to provide secure communication between a server and a remote client.
